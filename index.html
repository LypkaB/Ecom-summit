                    <p>
                        Dear aspiring eCommerce Entrepreneur, this is going to be the first time anything like this has
                        ever been done - and WOW, we are excited you are here!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's time to host the first ever Everything eCom Summit Virtual Summit!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've teamed up all together to put all our knowledge and combined years of experience
                        (lets not forget over $20MM in sales) to help everyone who have been struggling get started,
                        build, and scale a successful eCommerce business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One more while Dan was doing his morning routine he had an incredible idea. Grabbed his phone &
                        thought about the 2 most well known eCommerce experts that knew, without a shadow of a doubt in
                        his mind, knew their information. Two individuals who not only practiced what they preached but
                        also had MILLIONS of dollars in results to back them up. The first two individuals he reached
                        out to that fit that criteria was Jared Goetz and Scott Hilse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All together, they sat down and saw that there was a slew of misinformation in the eCommerce
                        space. So many fake 'gurus' and YouTube personalities who were pretending to be 'real'
                        entrepreneurs, all telling you and the community what to do. However all that information is
                        completely incorrect and outdated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've made it our mission and purpose to become the leaders in the eCommerce market. We knew the
                        first step was to set-up a Virtual Training Ground where everyone and anyone, from all over
                        the world, could join us & can learn how to build a real eCommerce business without all the hype
                        and misleading information floating around right now...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I want to do now is go over a few questions you may have. Let's figure out together if this
                        event is right for you or not...
